# Use of pmd provides these options:

- checks all the code and shows where exactly the error is and that it will show and it will even give an example
why is it showing an error how can you resolve them so this is a this!

# problem

I could not run pmd on netbeans. so I have download easypmd plugin. 

For it to work, I maked sure about 3 conditions are there.
-  action items windows is visible
-  scanning scope in the left part of that window is selected.
-  check that the filter button is not impressed state


but I still could not make it work.
