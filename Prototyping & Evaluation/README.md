# The task

There are tre digital ocean droplets that are all set up to respond to ping:
- 128.199.144.199
- 167.99.51.33
- 46.101.253.149

The task is to plan, setup, execute, and evaluate a small experiment concerning these three servers. 
In particluar you have to:


- Formulate a hypothesis/problem statement about behavior of ping times of these three servers.
- Plan an experiment, which measures response times of these three servers.
- Execute the experiment, which measures response times of these three servers.
- Evaluate your experiment and interpret the measurements and results.
- Discuss what you are measuring, how you are measuring, and what could influence your results.

# Finding location


# Behavior of ping times of these three servers

- ping 128.199.144.199 >> singaphour.txt
- ping 46.101.253.149 >> germany.txt
- ping 167.99.51.33 >> usa.txt


# Measures response times of these three servers

First I have found where this ip belong to and so found the distance between my location to the places where ip locations are. 
So I've pinged from 2 different loction to the 3 ip addresses.

so I could see the average for the first location is different from the next loction. 
Due to it's distance between 2 locations
