# Behavior of ping times of these three servers

The response time is depend on distance between server and request point (client). According to this relativity, with longer distance, respons time would increase.

# Expriment has done through the following approach: 

Response time and distance to server has been measured in a paticular location. Experiment has repeatet in another particular location. Comparing the distances to several servers and also compare the data which are provided from to particular location, shows the response time clearly.

# Measures response times of these three servers

First I have found where this ip belong to and also the distance between my location to the places where ip locations are. 
So I've pinged from 2 different loction to the 3 ip addresses.

so I could see the average for the first location is different from the next loction. 
Due to it's distance between 2 locations

- Resource : 
```sh
The website to find the location of particular ip:
 ```

```sh
```

* In the most client/server applications, there are many clients which are connected to one server, while, there is one client and many servers in linqpad, such az mysql, xml, sql server ...


+ LINQPad doesn't work in Mono primarily because it relies on ActiPro's SyntaxEditor which does some Win32 interop. LINQPad itself also does some interop.

- An early prototype of LINQPad used a TextBox instead of a syntax editor - this might be what was tested against Mono. Linqpad uses LINQ to SQL rather than Entity Framework because LINQ to SQL is lighter and faster in building the metamodel when instantiated.

Conclusion:
> A brief summary of which aspect of the exercise was taking you the longest time to solve, which part of the exercise was side tracking you the most (which dead-ends did you pursue), and what was the most helpful information you came across (it could be someone else helping you). How can you avoid those problems in the future, and how can the helpful resources help you in the future?

The most challenging part, was to understand what Linkpad is and how it can help to execute a query easier from different DB specially sql. In addition, it was good practice in getting queries from serveral servers by simple syntax. Syntaxs are based on .NET, as for, it could be easy for a client to take query from various servers.
